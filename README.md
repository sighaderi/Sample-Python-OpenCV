In this Python version of the code, we use the cv2 module from OpenCV to load the image from file, convert it to grayscale, apply a Gaussian blur, and apply Canny edge detection. We also save the output image to a file named "output.jpg". Finally, we display both the input and output images using the cv2.imshow function and wait for a key press before closing the display windows using cv2.waitKey and cv2.destroyAllWindows.
